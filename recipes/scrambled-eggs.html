        <p1>
            Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs), where 
            the whites and yolks have been stirred, whipped, or beaten together 
            typically with salt, butter or oil, and sometimes water or milk, or 
            other ingredients, then heated so that the proteins denature and 
            coagulate, and they form into "curds".
