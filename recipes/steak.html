        <h1>The Perfect Filet Mignon</h1>

        <p1>
            Filet mignon, a slice of beef cut from the small, narrow end of the 
            tenderloin, generally the most expensive steak on the market.
            Located at the top of a cow or steer just ahead of the hind legs, 
            the tenderloin has few connective tissues and carries no weight, earning 
            it the tender portion of its name. The filet mignon, whose name derives 
            from the French phrase meaning “delicate” or “dainty” fillet, is the most 
            tender part of the tenderloin. Other valued cuts of meat from the tenderloin 
            include chateaubriand and part of a porterhouse or T-bone steak.
